# hello-world
Repository for ideas and doing new things.

I'm a bit newer(I'm 18 in 2018) to coding and I want to try a lot of new things. This is technically my 3rd of learning code, and all of the things I have learned are self-taught. I started with a little bit of Minecraft modding and I might try to go back to it. Recently I've been getting into web developement to try and start somewhere and get experience. I was the main coder on my schools robotics team for FIRST for one year. My ultimate goal is to get into game design and maybe even start up my own company if I get the chance. Currently I know HTML, JavaScript, CSS, some C++, some C#, and Java.
